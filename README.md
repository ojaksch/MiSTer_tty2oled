## Playground addendum:
* ~~Create the folder ***/media/fat/tty2oledpics*** on the MiSTer device .
Then copy the content of ***Pictures/XBM_SD*** of this repo to this newly created directory.~~

* Download the update/install script **update_tty2oled.sh** to ***/media/fat/Scripts*** at the MiSTer device and run it by typing **update_tty2oled.sh** at MiSTer's console.  
Script will download the needed files, start a daemon and you should see the first logo at the OLED :video_game:

~~Continue with the installation as described in the [WIKI](https://github.com/venice1200/MiSTer_tty2oled/wiki).~~
