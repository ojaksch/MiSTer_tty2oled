### This is the "high" version for 3.12" SSD1322 displays

If you want an external case for your tty2oled and have used pin headers to stack the display to the PCB's, this should fit your needs.
Inserting the PCBs or the complete setup into the case is a fiddling thing. To counteract this I've glued the 4 spacer to displays and stacking PCB and was able to use the whole thing very easily.

After inserting screw together case and display/spacer, then put up the lid onto case's back. There're two 3mm holes which may be used to screw case and lid together, but this isn't mandatory and you keep easier access to the ESP :wink:


The ZIP archive presented [here](https://github.com/venice1200/MiSTer_tty2oled/blob/main/PCBs_and_Cases/Cases/ssd1322-high-version/MiSTer_tty2oled.zip) contains ready-to-use STL files for using with 3D printers and other rocket science. But if you're interested in remixing, reworking or customising the case or parts of it, there're [OpenSCAD](https://openscad.org) files for this also included.
